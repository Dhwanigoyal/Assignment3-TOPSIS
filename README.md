# Assignment3-TOPSIS  
### NLP Similarity and TOPSIS Ranking Project  

## Overview  

This project focuses on computing text similarity using various state-of-the-art NLP models from Hugging Face and ranking them based on their similarity scores through the TOPSIS decision-making technique. By leveraging these models, users can compare the semantic closeness between textual data and make better decisions on which models perform optimally.  

##  Key Highlights  

- **NLP Model Evaluation:** Use models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT for text similarity computations.  
- **TOPSIS Integration:** Apply a multi-criteria decision-making approach to rank models based on similarity scores.  
- **Automated Reporting:** Save and export the model rankings to CSV for further analysis.
